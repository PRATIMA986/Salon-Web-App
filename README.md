# Salon-Web-App
 In this project, I made the website look nice and work well 
on different devices using HTML and CSS. I also added a strong security system 
for user logins using Django. I connected everything together so the website can 
save and get information from a database using both SQL and Python code.

# Grade-Master
Developed a simple mark entry and analysis tool that 
calculates the total mark, percentage, and provides a clear indication of the 
student's division based on the entered subject marks.

# Even Odd Detector
Created a simple tool that takes a user-inputted number and 
determines whether it's even or odd, providing instant feedback

# Calculator
Developed a minimalist calculator web app using Python and Django for backend functionality, and HTML/CSS for the frontend. 
Implemented basic arithmetic operations and utilized SQL for data storage.
